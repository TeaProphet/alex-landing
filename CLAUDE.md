# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Structure

This is a full-stack personal trainer landing page with two main parts:
- **Backend**: Strapi CMS (Headless CMS) in `/backend` directory
- **Frontend**: React SPA with Vite, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui in `/frontend` directory

The project creates a landing page for Alexander Paskhalis, a personal fitness trainer, with contact information and service descriptions.

## Development Commands

### Backend (Strapi CMS)
```bash
cd backend
npm run develop    # Development server with auto-reload
npm run build      # Build admin panel
npm run start      # Production server
```

### Frontend (React/Vite)
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev        # Development server
npm run build      # Production build
npm run lint       # ESLint
npm run preview    # Preview production build
```

## Architecture Overview

### Backend Architecture
- **Strapi v5.18.1** headless CMS
- **Content Types**:
  - `contacts` (singleType): Stores contact information (telegram, instagram, whatsapp, phone, email, main photo)
  - `services-blocks` (collectionType): Service descriptions with title, rich text, and multiple photos
- **Database**: SQLite (better-sqlite3)
- **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints auto-generated by Strapi at `/api/{content-type}`

### Frontend Architecture
- **React 18** with TypeScript
- **Vite** for build tooling
- **React Router** for routing (currently just Index and NotFound pages)
- **shadcn/ui** component library with Radix UI primitives
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **TanStack Query** for data fetching
- **Component Structure**:
  - `pages/Index.tsx`: Main landing page with hero, about, services, contacts sections
  - `components/ServiceSection.tsx`: Reusable service display component
  - `components/ServiceCarousel.tsx`: Image carousel for services
  - `components/SocialIcons.tsx`: Social media icons component
  - `components/ui/`: shadcn/ui components

### Key Features
- Responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Hero section with contact info overlay
- Services sections with alternating image layouts
- Social media integration (Instagram, Telegram, WhatsApp)
- Smooth scrolling navigation

## Content Management
- Content is managed through Strapi admin panel (accessible when backend is running)
- Static content is currently hardcoded in frontend components
- Images are stored in `/backend/public/uploads/` with automatic resizing

## API Integration
- Frontend fetches dynamic content from Strapi backend
- **API Configuration**: Located in `/frontend/src/lib/api.ts`
- **API Services**: Located in `/frontend/src/lib/strapiApi.ts`
- **Contact Data**: Includes email, phone, social media logins, main photo, greeting text, and about info
- **Services Data**: Dynamic service blocks with title, rich text content, and multiple photos

## Development Notes
- Frontend uses Russian language content
- Content is now dynamic from Strapi CMS (falls back to hardcoded defaults if API fails)
- Backend must be running on localhost:1337 for full functionality
- Uses React Query for API state management with loading states
- No authentication system implemented
- No form submissions - contact via social media/phone only
